                <h5 class="grey-text fw-600">2. Solar Manufacturing</h5>
                  <p class="grey-text">Solar power installations are made up of hundreds of components, from solar modules that generate power to the racking systems that hold them in place to the inverters that connect the system to your home. While some of these components are produced overseas, many are manufactured right here in America, in factories that employ workers similar to other high-tech industries.</p>
                  <p class="grey-text">Solar module producers accounted for 31% of manufacturing respondents to the National Solar Jobs Census, including six major manufacturing facilities reporting plans to expand operations. Another 28% of U.S. solar manufacturers produce mounting hardware, 24% produce monitoring systems, 15% produce inverters, 12% produce trackers, and 21% produce other solar-related equipment. (That adds up to more than 100% because some vertically-integrated manufacturers produce equipment for more than one part of the supply chain.)</p>
                  <p class="grey-text">According to the Solar Foundation, there are over 17,000 solar manufacturing and production roles in the U.S. Entry-level manufacturing jobs pay a median wage of $24.46/hour, with median wages going up to $32.61/hour for the highest-paid manufacturing workers.</p>

            <h5 class="grey-text fw-600">3. Solar Sales Representatives</h5>
            <p class="grey-text">Solar may be booming, but those solar panels don’t sell themselves! Solar sales representatives are employed by installation companies that sell to homeowners and business, either by phone or door-to-door. Higher up the supply chain, solar equipment manufacturers also have wholesale sales representatives that engage in more complex negotiations with other solar companies. </p>
            <p class="grey-text">After the sale, consumer-facing solar companies may employ large numbers of customer service representatives to ensure a high level of customer satisfaction (and good reviews and referrals). Regardless of whether you’re dealing with home solar prospects, existing customers, or buyers from downstream solar companies, all of these sales representative positions require strong communications skills.</p>
            <p class="grey-text">According to the Solar Foundation, there are about 36,000 solar sales reps in the U.S. While the National Solar Jobs Census doesn’t have wage data for these roles in the solar context, Bureau of Labor Statistics data indicates a median wage of $11.24/hour for retail sales roles in general, $15.81 for customer service reps, and $29.01/hour for wholesale and manufacturing sales reps.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-10 mb-4">
            <h5 class="grey-text fw-600">4. Administrative Positions</h5>
            <p class="grey-text">Administrative professionals make up the backbone of any company, and solar companies are no exception. In fact, office staff like receptionists, administrative assistants, and filing clerks make up one of the largest segments of the solar workforce! These roles may require little or no solar-specific training and are a great way to get involved in solar if you have administrative experience from another industry.</p>
            <p class="grey-text">According to the Solar Foundation, there are over 38,478 administrative positions at U.S. solar companies. While the National Jobs Census doesn’t have solar-specific wage data for these positions, the Bureau of Labor Statistics lists a median wage for receptionists of $13.65/hour, for office clerks of $15.14/hour, and for administrative assistants of $18.21/hour. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-lg-10 mb-4">
            <h5 class="grey-text fw-600">5. “Other” Solar Jobs</h5>
            <p class="grey-text">While the four roles described above account for over three quarters of all jobs in the solar industry, there are a wide range of more specialized career paths as well. These “other” solar jobs include academic research, government oversight, research & development, training, management, nonprofits, finance, engineering, consulting, law, and communications.</p>
            <p class="grey-text">Some of these positions may require years of solar-specific expertise, such as solar system designers or engineers, while others leverage skills used in a wide range of industries. For example, like most high-tech industries, a growing number of solar companies employ software developers. There’s also demand for experienced professionals in finance, legal, and other professional and support services. </p>

                So we created a new way for people to take action. It's a pretty simple idea. We crowdsource funding to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations. As these organizations pay us back, we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building more and more solar.
                <span class="fw-500">It's a pay-it-forward model for solar energy. We call it the Solar Seed Fund.</span>
                Spread clean energy and make a tax-deductible donation to the Solar Seed Fund.</p>
