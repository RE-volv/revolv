              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">Today is a
                  national holiday where we take time to reflect on the legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
                  Jr.&nbsp;</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">When I reflect on
                  Dr. King, often I think about how his philosophy of nonviolent movement building and his tactics of
                  grassroots community-based organizing can be applied to solving the climate crisis.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">But today, as we
                  sit with the pain of our divided nation, and are continuing to process events of this past year,
                  culminating in the
                  unthinkable acts of an armed insurrection taking over our Capital, by people carrying confederate
                  flags, with “Civil War” written on their shirts, I feel that King's teachings are more relevant now
                  than ever, and they can help us navigate this moment and help us heal the divide in our
                  country.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">The title of his

              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">The hard won
                  victories of Dr. King and the civil rights
                  movement we’re not an isolated moment in history - but rather were a continuation of a long hard
                  struggle for racial equality and social justice that has persisted in this country since its founding
                  and requires just as much effort today as it has the entire time.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">As Cornel West
                  points out in his anthology of King’s writings “<a style="text-decoration:underline;color:#ff8a00"

                    Radical King</a>,” we often forget how <i>radical</i> King was. Not only in his critiques of our
                  system, but also in his radical belief in the power of love to heal and to transform.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">On the one hand
                  King was clear that “Something is wrong with the economic system of our nation...something is wrong
                  with capitalism…there must be a better distribution of wealth.” And that “in a nation which has a
                  gross national product of $750 Billion a year, it is morally right to insist that every person have a
                  decent house, an adequate education and enough money to provide basic necessities for one’s family.”
                  (Worth noting that the US GNP is now over $20 Trillion and we spend over $750 Billion a year just on
                  the military.)</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">But on the other
                  hand King reminds us to “love our enemies by realizing that they are not totally bad and that they are
                  not beyond...reach.” He preached that “we must not seek to defeat or
                  humiliate the enemy but to win his friendship and understanding.” He taught that “hate is just as
                  injurious to the person who hates.”</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">Here is an excerpt
                  from his 1963 sermon "Loving your Enemies”: </span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">“There will be no
                  permanent solution to the race problem until oppressed men develop the capacity to love their enemies.
                  The darkness of racial injustice will be dispelled only by the light of forgiving love...We are
                  tempted to become bitter and to retaliate with a corresponding hate. But if this happens, the new
                  order we seek will be little more than a duplicate of the old order. We must in strength and humility
                  meet hate with love...</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">...Do I sound like
                  most preachers- idealistic and impractical? Maybe in some distant Utopia, you say, that idea will
                  work, but not in the hard, cold world in which we live.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">My friends, we
                  have followed the so-called practical way for too long a time now, and it has led inexorably to deeper
                  confusion and chaos. Time is cluttered with the wreckage of communities which surrendered to hate and
                  violence. For the salvation of our nation and the salvation of mankind, we must follow another way.
                  This does not mean we abandon our righteous efforts. With every ounce of our energy we must continue
                  to rid this nation of the incubus of segregation. But we shall not in the process relinquish our
                  privilege and our
                  obligation to love. </span><span style="color:#100084"><b>While abhorring segregation, we shall love
                    the segregationist. This is the only way to create the beloved community.</b></span>"</p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">This historical
                  moment we find ourselves in is unprecedented, and I don't think anyone knows what it will take to
                  truly heal the deep wounds in our country. But perhaps if we reflect on Dr.King’s words and acts, some
                  good will come out of that.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">“To guard
                  ourselves from bitterness we need the vision to see in this generation’s ordeals the opportunity to
                  transfigure both ourselves and American society,” he wrote.</span></p>
              <p style="Margin-top:20px;Margin-bottom:0;line-height:1.38"><span style="color:#000000">May we take a
                  moment today to be grateful for all those who have worked to make our world a more just, equitable,
                  loving place, and have taught us by their example.</span></p>
