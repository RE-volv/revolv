                        communities to invest collectively in renewable energy. RE-volv lets individuals who support clean
                        energy chip in a few dollars to help communities all over the United States go solar. These
                        donations help finance solar systems for community-based nonprofits that lack access to
                        traditional solar financing.</p>
                      <p>These organizations save money on their electric costs while paying RE-volv back through a 20-year
                        lease with interest. The lease payments are reinvested in a revolving fund, the Solar Seed Fund,
                        which continually finances new community-based solar projects. Over time, each dollar donated to
                        an individual solar project will go towards financing a new project, which will help finance the
                        next project, and so on.</p>

                        lease payments help another nonprofit to go solar, and so on.
                        As more and more nonprofits go solar, our collective impact on climate change grows exponentially.
                        To top it all off, at the end of the lease, we transfer ownership of the system to each nonprofit

                        the system outright at no additional cost.</p>

                        payments, which goes into the Solar Seed Fund. Over the course of their lease, the nonprofit will
                        pay for more nonprofits to go solar â€“ each of which will fund more solar projects (and so on and

                        we repay nonprofits for the deficit. Specifically, we reimburse the annual difference between
                        expected and actual output at the end of each year â€“ a money-back guarantee per kilowatt-hour.
                        To date, none of our systems have under-produced.</p>
                      <p>To fulfill this guarantee, RE-volvâ€™s solar monitoring equipment reports on 15-minute intervals,
                        so weâ€™re able to diagnose any problems quickly. At the end of each year, RE-volv will send a
                        report of the systemâ€™s performance over the last year, along with reimbursement for any deficit.

                      <p>There are several options when a building changes ownership. We can easily transfer the lease
                        to the new owner, and the new owner would continue the lease as normal. Or, the nonprofit can
                        use our early buyout option to pay-off the lease at a discounted rate, then include the solar
                        system in the property valuation. On the other hand, if a nonprofit retains ownership of the
                        building and leases the space to new tenants, the solar lease payments could be included in the
                        new tenantâ€™s property lease payments.</p>

                        installer can then work with the re-roofing contractor to remove the panels and reinstall them.

                        ownership, the lease continues as before, but the same lease payments are made to the new system
                        owner. The lease specifies that all obligations for any new system owner remain the same, and
                        any substantial change to the lease requires signatures from both parties. So, nonprofits will
                        continue to receive all the benefits of solar as stated in the lease, but will make the lease
                        payments to a different organization.</p>

                      <p> When you donate to a RE-volv, 100% of your donation goes towards installing solar on a
                        community-serving nonprofit. Your donation will help fight climate change and reduce the
                        nonprofitâ€™s electricity costs by 15% or more. As the nonprofit makes lease payments to our
                        revolving fund, the Solar Seed Fund, your donation is repaid to your RE-volv portfolio. Then you
                        can invest those repayments into another nonprofitâ€™s solar system and continue the cycle! </p>
