                <p style="color:white;">We believe that everyone should have the ability to support and spread clean energy. 
                  So we created a new way for people to take action. It's a pretty simple idea. 
                  We crowdsource to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations. 
                  As these organizations pay us back, we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. 
                </p> 
                <p style="color:white;"> Help us spread solar and bring the benefits of clean energy to communities that need it most. </p>
