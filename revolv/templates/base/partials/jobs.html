                <p style="color:white;">We believe that everyone should have the ability to support and spread clean energy. 
                  So we created a new way for people to take action. It's a pretty simple idea. 
                  We crowdsource to put solar panels on community-serving nonprofit organizations. 
                  As these organizations pay us back, we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the country. 
                </p> 
                <p style="color:white;"> Help us spread solar and bring the benefits of clean energy to communities that need it most. </p>

                    <p><strong>Reports To:</strong> Senior Solar Account Manager</p>

                    <h5>The Solar Program Associate role</h5>
                    <p>The Solar Program Associate will support RE-volv’s solar program on multiple fronts with a primary focus on sales, as well as solar project management, asset management, and operations and maintenance. The best candidate will have a record of successfully supporting solar sales, managing customer relationships, and maintaining data integrity, as well as the ability to learn quickly and creatively problem solve. They will have exemplary quantitative and analytical skills, possess a high attention to detail, exhibit excellent communication skills, and bring a positive attitude to the team.

                    <h5>About RE-volv</h5>
                    <p> RE-volv is a nonprofit social enterprise fighting climate change and working to build a more sustainable and equitable world. We do this by accelerating the adoption of clean energy in local communities. RE-volv empowers people to bring clean energy to their communities by providing the upfront costs of installing solar energy systems to local nonprofits. Through an innovative solar financing model, these nonprofits immediately save on their electricity costs, while their monthly solar payments contribute to a revolving fund, which helps pay for the next nonprofit’s solar system – a first-of-its-kind pay-it-forward model for renewable energy financing we call the Solar Seed Fund.</p>

                    <p> RE-volv has received numerous awards, including a Business Innovation Award from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Sunshot Initiative, is an inaugural member of the White House National Community Solar Partnership, and winner of the OpenIDEO Climate Innovation Fellowship.</p>

                    <p> RE-volv is at an exciting moment in the life of the organization. With over 1MW of solar financed for 35 nonprofits in 13 states, and with a tax equity finance partnership in place, the opportunity to scale is massive.</p>

                    <h5> Position Details</h5>
                    <p> Your role as the Solar Program Associate will be to help process solar leads as they are received, collect electric bills from customers interested in solar, enter data into Salesforce and Energy Toolbase, help coordinate sales of solar projects across the country, maintain positive relationships with customers, and support the team in meeting deployment goals. </p>
                    <p> This is a full time position that can be done remotely. We do have an office in the Financial District of San Francisco, which is available for employees to use with proper health-safety precautions, but due to the ongoing pandemic all RE-volv employees are now able to work remotely. This is a high impact position, requiring creativity, independence, collaboration and initiative. Compensation includes an annual salary commensurate with experience, healthcare and retirement benefits, and generous paid time off. RE-volv also provides the last Friday of every month off for personal care, which we call RE-charge Days. RE-volv allows flexible work hours and is committed to supporting a good work-life balance.</p>
                    <p> By choosing to work at RE-volv, you know that your efforts everyday are not just helping promote solar, but helping myriad nonprofits lower their electric bill, so they can be more successful in serving their communities around the country. Position starts as soon as possible.</p>
