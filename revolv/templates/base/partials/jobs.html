                <p style="color:white;">We believe that everyone should have the ability to support and spread clean energy. 
                  So we created a new way for people to take action. It's a pretty simple idea. Through an innovative
                  solar financing model, these nonprofits immediately save on their electricity costs. As these
                  organizations pay us back, we reinvest the money into more solar projects in communities across the
                  country. This creates a revolving fund for solar energy that continually perpetuates itself building
                  more and more solar.
                </p> 
                <p style="color:white;"> Help us spread solar and bring the benefits of clean energy to communities that need it most. </p>

                      finances, human resources, and business operations at RE-volv. The Director of Operations will be

                      technological and operational systems as we scale. The ideal candidate will have demonstrated track
                      record in nonprofit management, solar project finance, HR, managing IT systems, and successfully
                      scaling organizations. They will also have a deep understanding of the clean energy and climate justice
                      space, and the ability to learn quickly and creatively problem solve. They will have exemplary

                  <h5>About RE-volv</h5>
                  <p> RE-volv is a nonprofit social enterprise fighting climate change and working to build a more sustainable
                      and equitable world. We do this by empowering people to bring clean energy to their communities,
                      providing the upfront costs of installing solar energy systems to local nonprofits, and educating local
                      community members about the benefits of clean energy in the process. Through an innovative solar
                      finance model, these nonprofits immediately save on their electricity costs, while their monthly solar
                      payments contribute to a revolving fund, which helps pay for the next nonprofit’s solar system – a
                      first-of-its-kind pay-it-forward model for renewable energy we call the Solar Seed Fund.</p>

                  <p> RE-volv has received numerous awards, including a Business Innovation Award from the U.S.
                      Department of Energy’s Sunshot Initiative, is an inaugural member of the White House National
                      Community Solar Partnership, and winner of the OpenIDEO Climate Innovation Fellowship.</p>

                  <p> RE-volv is at an exciting moment in the life of the organization. With nearly 3MW of solar financed for
                      42 nonprofits in 10 states that serve tens of thousands of people and Solar Ambassador fellows at 20
                      universities across the country, our track record is proven. The opportunity to scale is massive.</p>

                  <h5> Position Details</h5>
                  <p> Your role as the Director of Operations will be to manage all RE-volv operations including matters of
                      financial oversight, human resources, technology, and other internal functions. It will also include helping

                      supportive atmosphere among a group of diverse, talented individuals as the organization scales quickly
                      over the coming years. </p>

                  <p> This is a full time position that can be done remotely. We have an office in the Financial District of San
                      Francisco, which is available for employees to use with proper health-safety precautions. Due to the

                      personal care, which we call RE-charge Days. RE-volv allows flexible work hours and is committed to
                      supporting a good work-life balance.</p>

                  <p> By choosing to work at RE-volv, you know that your efforts everyday are not limited to just helping
                      promote clean energy and fight climate change. You are also helping a myriad of nonprofits lower their

                      we can create a more just and equitable society.</p>
