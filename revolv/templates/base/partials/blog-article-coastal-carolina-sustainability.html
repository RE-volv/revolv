              Back in October there was a conference in San Antonio, Texas under the theme of “Stronger in
              Solidarity.” It’s a big conference, and very specific. The conference is held by the Association for
              the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education - or AASHE. It’s an annual three day
              conference for folks from around the world who work in sustainability, specifically in a higher
              education setting, to talk about everything they’ve been doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              The talks/workshops range from thirty minutes to one hour and could be on a wide variety of things - campus
              efficiency, food safety, and recycling programs are just some of the examples. They could be experiments conducted or
              programs started. There are also poster sessions as well as vendors set up all
              conference long.
            </p>
            <p>
              My two colleagues and I represented Coastal Carolina University in Myrtle Beach, South
              Carolina as well as RE-volv with Andreas. Our session was called “Being a RE-volv Solar
              Ambassador on Your Campus and in Your Community: Practical and Curricular Training and
              Experiences,” in which we took turns explaining our experiences, motivations, and reflections on
              the program. Presenting in another state in front of strangers for the first time was nerve
              wracking, but it was a great experience for someone may who want to work in public/community
              engagement in the future. Even just being at the conference was surreal, there was so much
              knowledge the event was spread between three buildings!
            </p>
            <p>
              There is so much potential in the conference it is intimidating. That’s why I think it is a great
              experience, whether you be an ambassador with RE-volv, a sustainability coordinator at a
              school, or even a sociology professor who helped on an efficiency experiment (seriously, I went
              to a talk just like that!), there are so many ideas to absorb and bring home with you.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next <a href="http://www.aashe.org/conference/">conference</a> is going to be held in Pittsburgh, PA under the
              theme “Global Goals: Rising
              to the Challenge,” and I know I will try to be there - hopefully representing my school and RE-
              volv again. Check if your school is a member of AASHE, look into options to get you there. It is
              an experience worth having!
