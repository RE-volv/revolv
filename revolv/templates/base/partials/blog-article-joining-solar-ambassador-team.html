            <p>
              Being from a small rural town in northeastern Pennsylvania, I grew up with a unique experience in terms of
              fossil fuels and the energy sector. When I was in middle school, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/natural-gas/natural-gas-and-the-environment.php" target="_blank">natural gas</a> extraction became a booming
              business, and my hometown fell right in the middle of <a href="https://stateimpact.npr.org/pennsylvania/tag/marcellus-shale/" target="_blank">The Marcellus Shale</a>. I got front row seats to watch
              a non-renewable energy source develop right in front of my eyes. The impacts of this, both good and bad,
              deeply affected my entire community. I moved away almost three years ago; however, it was not until this
              past year that I was educated on the idea of renewable energy sources. More specifically, solar energy.
              Now, as a member of one of <a href="https://re-volv.org/get-involved/team" target="_blank">RE-volv's Solar Ambassador Teams</a> at Coastal Carolina University, I get to also
              experience solar energy development and the impacts it has on my community I live in now.
            </p>

            <p style="color: #3e3e3e !important;">
                My hometown of Lawton, Pennsylvania mostly consists of farmers and quarriers. There are not many other options for
                employment that pay a livable wage. When the process of natural gas extraction was introduced to my community, it
                offered new employment opportunities and a way to boost our local economy. In addition, property owners who allowed
                fracking to take place on their property receive payments for the usage of their property. This was of course all
                taking place while all of America was still feeling the effects of the 2008 recession. As such, my community jumped on
                the opportunity. For the first time in my life, I got to see families rise out of the poverty level, the local
                population expand, and local businesses not just survive but thrive. Of course, there were some cons to this process
                as well. A lot of the land used for natural gas fracking sites had to be logged and excavated into a level site. Also,
                the large pipelines required to transport the natural gas had to be buried, which disturbed wildlife, habitats, and
                natural resources. When the drilling began, air pollution and large volumes of contaminated water were produced.
                Although these negative impacts were rather severe, the economic relief is all anyone wanted.

            </div>

            <p style="color: #3e3e3e !important;">
                After about five years, the volume of natural gas extraction started to decrease. As a result, so did some of the
                benefits. The population decreased as well, and members of the community had to move in order to maintain their jobs.
                The economic benefits have lasted in part, however not in impactful ways towards the community. This left me thinking
                that this was a short-term process with short term benefits. In dwelling on this, I had previously done minor research
                on solar as a long-term energy solution alternative. As a renewable energy source, it has the potential to be a
                lasting energy source with lasting benefits to the economy. The initial problem I saw with this was a lack of access.
                This includes both the inability of low-income families to afford the costs of switching to solar, and the lack of
                solar options to choose from at the time. I just couldnâ€™t see this as an option that the majority of my hometown would
                jump onboard with.

            <p>In the summer of 2020, I decided to take a class on sustainability in the fall semester. Little did I know, this
              class would include the opportunity to work directly with <a href="https://re-volv.org/get-involved/education/solarenergy/" target="_blank">solar energy</a>. A few weeks into the class I decided to join
              the Coastal Carolina Solar Ambassador Team and I completed RE-volv's bootcamp course on solar. This helped me to truly
              understand the entire process of switching to solar energy. Throughout my time so far as a Solar Ambassador, I have
              learned so much more. From different types of utility companies, rate structures, residential/community solar, panel
              types, marketing, etc., I have been well versed on solar. In addition, I also get to watch solar grow within my
              community by helping local non-profit organizations to make the switch to renewable energy. My entire perspective on
              solar as a renewable energy choice has done a turn around. I have gone from never even seeing a solar panel to now
              getting the opportunity to help install them. I understand now that solar energy options are far more accessible than
              I initially thought they were a few years ago. If it were not for RE-volv and the Solar Ambassador team that I am so
              lucky to be a part of, I may have never reached the perspective that I have. Thankfully I have, and I cannot wait to
              see what else I learn in the future.

                  was something I am super interested in. I would love to pursue a career in solar energy post
                  graduation. Ideally, I would like to continue using solar energy as a way to help non-profit
                  organizations and communities.
