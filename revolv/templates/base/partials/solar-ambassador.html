										<div class="fr-view">
											<p><strong>What do we mean by "solar energy"?</strong></p>
											<p>Technically speaking, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy"
													rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">solar energy</a> is energy emitted from the sun in
												the form of radiant light and heat. Sunlight shines on the earth every day making it a renewable
												source of energy that will never run out. Therefore, technologies that capture this energy and
												allow us to use it in our lives - thereby replacing our current dependence on non-renewable
												resources - are highly valuable. In fact, if we could capture all the energy that falls on the
												earth during one hour of sunshine, we'd have enough energy to power the whole planet for an
												entire year!</p>
											<p>There are many technologies that harness solar energy, but the two most widely used energy
												technologies are <u>solar thermal</u> and <u>solar photovoltaics</u>. Solar thermal uses solar
												energy to heat water, while solar photovoltaics use solar energy to generate electricity.
												RE-volv only works with solar photovoltaics (at least for now...), so <strong>anytime we use the
													term "solar energy", we're referring to solar photovoltaics.</strong></p>
											<p>Key Terms:</p>
											<p><strong>Solar Photovoltaic (Solar PV)-</strong> The technology that turns sunshine ("photons")
												directly into electricity ("voltage"). Solar PV modules convert sunlight into DC (Direct
												Current) electricity.<br><br><strong>Solar Panel</strong>- &nbsp;A solar panel is a rectangular
												unit containing an assembly of connected PV cells, usually made of silicon wafers, framed in
												glass and metal so they can be safely transported and installed. When solar panels are combined
												they form a solar array.</p>
											<p><strong>Inverter</strong>- Transforms electricity from DC (Direct Current) &nbsp;to AC
												(Alternating Current). AC electricity is what our homes and appliances use.<br><br><br></p>
											<p>Check out the picture below for a better understanding of how a solar PV system works. Although
												there are many more parts that constitute a safe and fully-functioning solar system, <strong>the
													defining components of a solar system are: (1) the</strong> <strong>solar panels, (2) the
													inverter, (3) the electrical panel (which feeds power to your appliances), and (4) the
													electricity meter.</strong></p>
											<p><br></p>

										<div class="fr-view">
											<p>Solar panels are rated in Watts (W) which is a unit of power. A typical solar panel ranges from
												180-360 W. In other words, if a 300 W panel is sitting directly in the sun, it will create 300
												watts of power at that moment in time or about the amount of watts it takes to power a
												blender.<br><br>But we actually want to track energy production and the unit for energy
												production is Watt-hours (Wh). So a 300 W panel, if it was sitting in the sun producing power
												for one hour, would produce 300 Wh.<br><br>The most common unit for tracking electrical energy
												is kilowatt-hours (kWh). (1 kWh = 1,000 Wh)&nbsp;</p>
											<p>The average American home gets four hours of full sunshine a day, so that's when the panels are
												producing at their maximum capacity.</p>
											<p>So for example, a 300 W panel getting four hours of sunshine a day will produce 1200 Wh per day
												or 1.2 kWh. Multiply that by 365 days a year and each 300W panel will produce 438 kWh per year.
												If you have 10 panels on the roof that will produce roughly 4,380 kWh per year. According to the
												U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average U.S. residential customer uses approximately
												909 kWh per month of energy, or <strong>around 10,909</strong> kWh per year.&nbsp;</p>
											<p><strong>Measuring the Sunshine</strong></p>
											<p>There are a few things that affect how well solar systems can produce energy from the sun:</p>
											<p><strong>1. The time of year or time of day</strong></p>
											<p><br></p>

											<p><br></p>
											<p><strong>2. Array Orientation</strong></p>
											<p>In the northern hemisphere, the sun is always in the southern sky - so it's ideal for solar
												panels to face south. Although most roof planes aren't facing due south, they can still have
												great potential for solar. The real takeaway here is that <strong>roof planes facing north
													aren't a good place to install solar.</strong></p>
											<p>The other factor related to roof planes is the pitch of the roof, which determines the
												<strong>tilt&nbsp;</strong>of the solar array. Tilt ranges from 0 to 90 degrees, where 0 degrees
												is laying flat, and 90 degrees is standing vertically. The ideal tilt for the system depends on
												geographic longitude, so there's no optimal tilt. The best tilt for a fixed array is generally
												the positioning which will yield the most direct radiation from the sun. Realistically, anything
												between 0-45 degree will generate plenty of solar energy.</p>
											<p><br></p>
											<p><br></p>
											<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/116442/images/8d0/fc8/c32/array.jpg"
													style="width: 650px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable"></p>
											<p><br></p>
											<p><strong>3. Shade</strong></p>
											<p>Lastly, the amount of sunlight that actually reaches the panels is a major factor in energy
												production. Clouds technically cast shade, but don't substantially block sunlight from reaching
												the solar panels. By contrast, a tree will cast nearly perfect shade on the area directly below
												it. When we're looking for potential sites for solar energy, we want to be aware of any trees or
												neighboring buildings that might cast a shadow on the solar system and reduce performance, often
												referred to as "shading."</p>

										<dd>
											<div class="fr-view">
												<p><strong>Why do we only work with nonprofits?</strong></p>
												<ul>
													<li>There are 1.5 million nonprofits in the U.S. with barriers to solar financing.&nbsp;</li>
													<li>Because nonprofits do not pay taxes, solar tax incentives like the &nbsp;<a
															href="https://www.seia.org/initiatives/solar-investment-tax-credit-itc"
															rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Solar Investment Tax Credit</strong></a>
														(ITC) <strong>d</strong><strong>o not apply to nonprofits making it difficult for nonprofits
															to go solar.&nbsp;</strong></li>
													<li>&nbsp;We want to help nonprofits save money on their operating costs, so they can use the
														additional income <strong>to better serve their communities and constituents. <br></strong>
													</li>
													<li>We also want the nonprofits to educate their communities on the benefits of clean energy,
														thereby <strong>promoting greater adoption of solar energy across the
															country.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
												</ul>
												<p dir="ltr"><strong>Identifying the “Right” Nonprofit</strong></p>
												<p dir="ltr">Going solar can be a terrific deal for a nonprofit, and a win-win-win for them,
													your community, and the environment. So how do you identify the “right” nonprofit to solarize?
													There are a few key characteristics to look for:</p>
												<ul>
													<li dir="ltr">
														<p dir="ltr">Well-Established: Organizations should have a strong local presence, with a
															demonstrated commitment to the community. Ideally, they should have been operating at
															their current location for at least 5 years but we will accept the minimum requirement of
															1 year.</p>
													</li>
													<li dir="ltr">
														<p dir="ltr">Solid Finances: Since RE-volv will be financing solar equipment for a nonprofit
															for 20 years, we need to make sure that they are in good financial standing. To check,
															we'll have organizations submit financial statements as part of the application process.
														</p>
													</li>
													<li dir="ltr">
														<p dir="ltr">Building Ownership (or Long-Term Lease): Solar panels are a long-term
															investment, so the nonprofit should have certainty that they’ll be at their current
															location for a long time. Ideally, they own their building, but a long-term lease (and a
															good relationship with their landlord) can also work.</p>
													</li>
													<li dir="ltr">
														<p dir="ltr">A New(ish) Roof: Roofs typically need replacing every 15 to 30 years. Since
															solar panels will produce power for 25 years or more, it’s best to install them on a roof
															that’s less than 5 years old so we don't have to take the panels off and put them back on
															again in a few years if they need to replace the roof. <strong>One of the first questions
																you should ask your potential nonprofit is, "how old is your roof?"</strong> Sometimes
															they'll need to do some digging to find out. Anything older than 10 years is something we
															shouldn't do. Sometimes, if their roof is very old, say 25 or 30 years old, and they have
															plans to replace it anyway, we can have them replace it before we put solar panels on the
															roof.</p>
													</li>
													<li dir="ltr">
														<p dir="ltr">Shading: Another thing to watch out for is shading. For example, if there are
															trees or tall buildings next to the nonprofit that cast shade on the roof, this will
															reduce the amount of energy the solar panels produce. Google has a tool called <a
																href="https://www.google.com/get/sunroof#p=0" rel="noopener noreferrer"
																target="_blank">Project Sunroof</a>, which shows the solar access of rooftops across the
															U.S. Not all roofs appear in Project Sunroof, but it's worth taking a look!&nbsp;</p>

												<h3><strong>1st Step: Find a Nonprofit</strong></h3>
												<p>1. Do you have an relationship already with a nonprofit in your area?</p>
												<p>2. Does someone you know? Friends, professors, colleagues? Ask around to see if anyone in
													your network has an established connection with a nonprofit.</p>
												<p>3. Contact local environmental clubs/organizations and see if they can connect you with any
													local nonprofits that might be interested in solar. Perhaps they can send out a message on
													social media or through their newsletter.</p>
												<p>4. Call local solar installers to see if they know of any nonprofits already interested in
													solar. Sometimes an installer will want to install solar for a nonprofit but the nonprofit
													doesn't have a way of financing it. That's where you come in!</p>
												<p>5. Google! You can always just Google local nonprofits and then cold call or email them but
													you will have the most success if you have some sort of personal connection.</p>
												<p>6. Reach out to community foundations that support nonprofits in your area. They might be
													interested in connecting you to their grantees to help them go solar.</p>
												<p><br></p>
												<h3><strong>2nd Step: Schedule a Meeting</strong></h3>
												<p>When you identify a nonprofit that could be a good fit for a RE-volv solar project, you're
													going to reach out to the organization to schedule a discovery meeting with the right person.
													In this meeting, ask the nonprofit's work and why they are interested in going solar.
													&nbsp;Explain to them the benefits of going solar with RE-volv and how you can help them
													achieve their goals.</p>
												<p>Unfortunately, it isn't always easy to get the attention of a nonprofit. Most nonprofits are
													hyper-focused on their mission and the need at-hand, which means that longer-term projects and
													opportunities like going solar tend to be overlooked. If you are already involved with the
													nonprofit or know someone there who can help you find the right audience for the discovery
													meeting - that's fantastic! If not, don't fret! Here are some tips to schedule your discovery
													meeting:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">Keep it brief</span></strong><span
															style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;- if you're introducing yourself by email, try to keep it
															under 200 words; if you're calling, try to keep your initial conversation less than 10
															minutes. Be mindful of their time and their priorities.</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Ask them about their interest in
																solar-&nbsp;</strong>the key to sales is to find out a potential customer's needs and
															see if you can help meet them. So before you start pitching all the great things about
															solar, ask them some questions. What are the nonprofits top priorities now? Have they ever
															looked into going solar before? Would they like to lower their electric bills? What could
															they do with savings from their electric bills? Are they looking for ways to reduce their
															environmental footprint? Would they like to increase their visibility in the community?
															That'll give you a better understanding of how going solar with RE-volv can help them meet
															their goals.</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Focus on the WHY</strong>- most people that are
															interested in going solar are happy to be saving money...but the real reason they want to
															go solar is to do the right thing. They want to help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels,
															accelerate clean energy adoption, and be a sustainability leader in their community. Talk
															to them about why you're a Solar Ambassador and ask them why they think going solar is the
															right thing to do.<strong><br></strong></span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Describe the benefits -&nbsp;</strong>in your
															initial communication, make sure to mention some of the high level benefits of going solar
															and partnering with RE-volv; use language that excites them about the opportunity you're
															presenting; listen to their needs and match them with the benefits we offer (use
															the&nbsp;</span><a
															href="https://re-volv.org/static/images/edu-media-img/RE-volv_One_Pager.pdf"><span
																style="font-size: 14px;"><em>RE-volv Solar One Pager</em></span></a><span
															style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;as a guide.)</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>No commitment required</strong> - remind them that
															the primary purpose of the discovery meeting is to explore partnering and discuss with
															them the benefits of going solar. There are no commitments required from them at this step
															in the process - RE-volv will not share their information with any other organization, and
															they can say no at any time during the discovery process.</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Ask for the right contact</strong> - don't settle
															for the general inbox or info@ handle! When you call, ask for the right person to speak to
															about this. Some examples might be the Facilities Manager, the head of Operations, the
															Executive Director, or a member of the Board. If they don't know who you should talk to,
															ask them who would be able to direct you to the right contact. Never settle for a quick no
															- always ask to speak to someone who is willing to chat with you about the
															opportunity!</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Vary your contact methods</strong> - if one contact
															method isn't yielding a response, try another. Alternate between emailing different
															contacts, calling different numbers, or visiting the nonprofit during certain times of the
															day. Don't leave voicemail after voicemail on the same person's phone - leave one
															voicemail, try other contact methods, then try leaving another after a few calls.</span>
													</li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Follow-up at least once per week&nbsp;</strong>-
															unless otherwise specified, keep up with the nonprofit at least once a week. Try to vary
															the time of day that you contact them, in case they have some sort of ongoing meeting or
															service at that time. And don't take silence to mean no! Nonprofits are almost always
															engaged in a long list of very important tasks, so they may be just unable to respond at
															that time or your contact info may have gotten lost in the fray. Send gentle, polite
															reminders that you're still there and interested in discussing this further with
															them.</span></li>
												</ul>
												<p><span style="font-size: 14px;"><br></span></p>
												<p><strong>Sample communications</strong></p>
												<p>Below are some example communications that you can use as a reference. Be sure to put this in

												<p><strong>The ultimate tool: listening</strong></p>
												<p>Remember that <u>your ultimate tool is the power of listening</u>. Ask the nonprofit about
													their organization, what issues they're currently struggling with, and help them determine
													whether it's the right time for them to go solar.</p>
												<h3><strong>3rd Step: Repeat</strong></h3>
												<p>As you explore partnerships with more and more nonprofits, you'll quickly discover how much
													work is required for a nonprofit to decide to go solar. So, we always recommend that you reach
													out to as many nonprofits as possible, with the aim of engaging <strong>no less than 5
														nonprofits</strong> in conversations about solar at the same time. Even if you've identified
													a great opportunity at your favorite nonprofit, there are many reasons that they may decide to
													not go solar right now, so it's best to have some back-up options. What happens if all five
													want to go solar? Great! We'll help them all go solar in the order they sign up!</p>

												<p class="fr-view" style="text-align: center;"><strong>COLLECTING ELECTRIC BILLS</strong></p>
												<p class="fr-view">You have a nonprofit interested in solar. Great! Now what do we need to move
													forward?</p>
												<p>In order to design a system that generates the appropriate amount of electricity, we'll need
													to know how much electricity they use throughout the year. That means we need to see
													<strong>12 months of utility</strong> <strong>bills</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to size
													the system.&nbsp;</p>
												<p>The utility bills also show the customer's <strong>rate plan</strong> which indicates how
													much they're being charged for the energy they use. This will allow us to determine how much
													we can save the nonprofit by going solar.</p>
												<p>We'll also need to know the name of their utility and their customer identification
													number/their account number.</p>
												<p>To recap: the information we need to capture from the utility bills are:</p>
												<ol>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Utility name</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Utility account number</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Rate plan</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Monthly energy usage (in kWh) over last 12 months</span>
													</li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Monthly bill costs over last 12 months</span></li>
												</ol>
												<p>Other information found on the bill - like their meter number or interval usage data - may be
													needed to complete the analysis. But more often than not, these 5 data points are the crucial
													pieces of information we'll need to move forward.</p>
												<p><strong>How do we find these 5 pieces of information?</strong></p>
												<p>Essentially, what we need are copies of 12 months of the nonprofit's electricity bills.
													However, rather than ask the nonprofit to photocopy 12 months of utility bill right away,
													there are some other routes we can explore.</p>
												<p>Usually this information is available in an online tool or summary table that can show the
													nonprofit's energy usage over the last year. Ask the nonprofit to try logging into their
													account on their utility's website and exporting this data into an Excel table or PDF.&nbsp;
												</p>
												<p><a href="https://utilityapi.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Utility API</a>
													is an online service available to customers in specific utilities which authorizes solar
													companies like ours to access historic usage data in the nonprofit's account. It's usually
													much simpler than trying to extract the data from the utility's website, but it's only
													available for customers of these <a
														href="https://support.utilityapi.com/hc/en-us/articles/229667647-What-Utilities-Does-UtilityAPI-Cover-"
														rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">specific utilities</a>.&nbsp;</p>
												<p>Finally, if the utility doesn't have an online portal and UtilityAPI isn't available for that
													utility, you can ask the nonprofit to call their utility and request their last 12 months of
													electricity usage data be sent to them by email. And make sure to inform the nonprofit about
													the 5 data points listed above - it's best to request all the information from the utility at
													the same time to minimize the back and forth.</p>
												<p>If all else fails, just ask the nonprofit to copy 12 months of their electricity bills.
													Whatever form the information comes in, we'll take care of compiling it all into a table and
													conducting the analysis in coordination with our installation partners.</p>
												<p><br></p>
												<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>SOLAR
															FINANCING</strong></span></p>
												<p>RE-volv offers two forms of financing to nonprofits: a Solar Lease or a Power Purchase
													Agreement (PPA). While a “solar lease" and “solar PPA” &nbsp;are very similar in practice,
													there is a key difference between the two. With a<strong>&nbsp;lease</strong>, you agree to
													pay a fixed monthly lease payment, which is calculated by estimating the amount of electricity
													the system will produce. With a<strong>&nbsp;PPA</strong>, you agree to purchase the power
													generated by the system at a set per-kWh price. There are a few factors that help RE-volv
													decide which type of financing a nonprofit will receive, but the primary determinant is
													geography. Since each state has different solar laws and regulations, and they're often
													changing, we have to determine each project on a case by case basis. More often than not, if
													your state allows PPAs, we'll use a PPA. If it doesn't, we'll use a lease. Any questions a
													nonprofit has about financing options should be referred to the RE-volv Solar Account Manager.

															PROPOSAL</strong></span></p>
												<p><strong>The proposal walk-through</strong></p>
												<p>Once you've collected the last 12 months of utility bills and sent them to RE-volv's Project
													Management team, we'll send out a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_proposal"
														rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">request-for-proposals</a>, or RFP, to local solar
													installers near the nonprofit. After we receive a few bids for the project, we'll compare them
													and select one. Then we'll use that installer's quote and system design to put together the
													RE-volv solar proposal to present to the nonprofit. The next step is for RE-volv to set up a
													<strong>p</strong><strong>roposal walk-through&nbsp;</strong>meeting.</p>
												<p>The RE-volv proposal is a 7-9 page document that explains the benefits of going solar with
													RE-volv, and provides detailed calculations about the solar system that we propose to install
													on the nonprofit's building. The proposal covers:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The expected size of system (i.e. number of solar
															panels)</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The expected energy output of the system, and what
															percentage of their electricity consumption that will cover over 25 years</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The lease/PPA payments and how they compare to the current
															cost of energy from the local utility</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">A short summary of their&nbsp;financing option and a
															timeline for the project</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The expected net savings of going solar over the next 25
															years</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">The environmental impact the solar system will have over
															the next 25 years</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">A rough overhead sketch of where we expect to install the

													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Some background information on RE-volv as well as the solar
															installer</span></li>
												</ul>
												<p>RE-volv's Solar Account Manager will lead the proposal walk-through. We ask each Solar

												</div>
												<p><br></p>
												<p><strong>Regular follow-ups</strong></p>
												<p>Now that you've successfully educated the nonprofit on the benefits of going solar, the
													decision-making process is largely in their hands. It may take them weeks or even months to
													make a final decision on our proposal, so patience is key at this stage.</p>
												<p>Our primary duty at this point is to equip our champion at the nonprofit with as much
													information as possible and let them know that we're here to help. Be available to answer any
													questions that they receive from other decision-makers, and if you receive any questions you
													don't know the answer to, reach out to the RE-volv Solar Account Manager.</p>
												<p>The most important way to keep proactive is to schedule regular follow-ups with the
													nonprofit. Ask about their decision-making process:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Who needs to approve the project before we can move
															forward?</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Does your Board of Directors meet regularly? If so,
															when?</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">What are the next steps in the decision-making
															process?</span></li>
													<li><span style="font-size: 14px;">Is there any additional information you will need before
															making a decision?</span></li>
												</ul>
												<p>Once you understand the decision-making process, scheduling regular follow-ups should be much
													easier. Try to follow-up with the nonprofit 1-3 days after the decision-makers meet. Keep
													following-up every 1-2 weeks to see how the discussion is going and if they need any
													additional support.</p>
												<p><br></p>
												<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
												<p>Undoubtedly, the nonprofit will have lots of questions about the proposal. Here are of the
													most common questions that we receive:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">What happens if the system isn't producing energy?
																How will we know whether it is or not?&nbsp;</span></strong><span
															style="font-size: 14px;">-Part of the solar installation includes a monitoring system that
															records how much energy is being produced by the solar system and posts it to a website in
															real time that RE-volv and the nonprofit can see. It also lets us know if it's
															under-producing, so we can send someone out to take a look.<br></span></li>
													<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">What happens if the nonprofit moves to a new
																building and sells their current building?</span></strong><strong><span
																style="font-size: 14px;">&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14px;">-If the
															nonprofit moves and sells their building to someone else, the new property owner would
															have to continue the terms of the solar lease.</span></li>
												</ul>
												<p><strong>Signing the contract</strong></p>
												<p>Once we've presented the opportunity to the nonprofit, walked them through the proposal, and
													answered all their questions about going solar with RE-volv - it's time for them to sign! Once
													they decide that going solar with RE-volv is the best fit for their organization, the RE-volv
													Solar Account Manager will finalize the details and send out a contract for e-signature. Once
													they've signed the contract, you're ready to start engaging and educating the community about
													the project and the benefits of solar!</p>

																<p dir="ltr">You’re going to want to come up with a catchy title and then write a few
																	paragraphs of copy that describes your team and what you're trying to accomplish, and
																	we'll post it on the RE-volv website.&nbsp;</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;</strong></p>
																<p dir="ltr">You will be using social media a lot during your fellowship to tell the
																	story of your efforts and to highlight the nonprofit you're solarizing. &nbsp;We
																	suggest you utilize Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, or wherever your network
																	is most active.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Your team will set up its own social media page to post from that you all
																	have access to, and you should take turns posting to it. Ideally, you're posting at
																	least once a day if not multiple times a day across multiple platforms. You also want
																	to share all of your social media on your personal accounts as well.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that when you and your followers like a post, comment on a
																	post or share a post, the Facebook algorithm will decide that it is popular content
																	and will show it to more people. Therefore make sure you, your teammates, and all your
																	friends and family and supporters are actively liking, commenting, and sharing your
																	posts.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">The more we share success stories highlighting the benefits of solar
																	energy, the better!</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><br></p>

																		class="fr-fic fr-dii fr-draggable" width="624" height="335"></p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>Prepare in Advance</strong></p>
																<p dir="ltr">Remember to always make life easier for yourself where you can. Before you
																	announce your nonprofit decided to go solar, draft short and compelling Facebook posts
																	and tweets tagging diverse groups and organizations whose audience would be interested
																	in the mission of your nonprofit or in fighting climate change. You'll be sending
																	these often to keep people informed on the stage of the project.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Here’s a template that you can use and customize for each social media
																	channel:</p>
																<ul>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Date for release: _/_/_</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Text:</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Make sure to draft a version of 280 characters or less for Twitter</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Photo:</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Campaign Link:</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Hashtags:</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Handles:</p>
																	</li>
																</ul>
																<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
																<p dir="ltr">Posting on social media regularly and often will help get people excited
																	about solar energy and your project. Actively posting updates on when the contract was
																	signed, when the install is going to happen, pictures and videos during the
																	installation, and then details about the ribbon cutting event and other solar
																	education events will give people more reason to want to get involved. Remember to ask
																	your team and personal networks to like, comment, and share your posts. That will help
																	the posts get higher visibility. Try to post to your social media accounts at least
																	once a day. Try posting at different times of day as well to experiment to see when
																	people are most likely to give. To help your posts get traction, consider posting
																	during <a
																		href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/best-times-to-post-on-social-media/">these
																		times</a>.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>GET YOUR CAMPAIGN IN THE PRESS</strong></p>
																<p dir="ltr">Each team should have a goal of getting at least one news article published
																	about your project if not multiple. This helps get the word out, which helps your
																	nonprofit get more attention for its leadership and it also gets more people to see
																	the benefits of solar in their community. You'll want to send out a press release and
																	get a story published when your nonprofit signs the Solar PPA or Lease, and you'll
																	also want to get coverage for your ribbon cutting event.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk0hicdMBgQ"></a></p>
																<p dir="ltr"><em>Press List</em> - This is a spreadsheet you and your team use to
																	compile a list of reporters that might cover the story. In it, you'll gather all the
																	information you need about reporters, including what news outlet they work for, their
																	email, phone number, what they typically write about, etc.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><em>Press Release</em> - A press release is a 1-2 page document you write
																	that tells the story about your solar project and why it's newsworthy. You'll want to
																	come up with a catchy headline that will get people's attention. Press releases follow
																	a very specific format. Take a look at <a
																		href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xgqmuTl2VD7zvP-To4fPPfeDwnrhy6xsVytabt8UMuk/edit"
																		rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this example</a> and try and use the same
																	format.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><em>Media Advisory</em> - A media advisory is similar to a press release
																	except rather than pitching a news story, you're pitching an event. It's a short
																	document that lets the media know about an event you have coming up. For example,
																	you're having a Solar Education event and the mayor of your town is speaking. You'll
																	want to give the media all the information they need to show up and cover the event:
																	who's speaking, where it's being held, what's it for, etc. Follow the format of <a
																		href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vedl4jxNqQsr_yLt7lSRUYtR1ZhlM3OpZxDagB36vl4/edit#heading=h.bft4rhk1mtme"
																		rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this example.</a></p>
																<p dir="ltr"><em>Email pitch</em> - Reporters get tons of press releases emailed to them
																	every day. So you need to make sure that you're cutting through the noise. You'll need
																	a catchy email subject line to get them to open the email. Then you'll need to
																	summarize the press release in a few bullet points like <a
																		href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wa7DsLAGiQGBOauyyujyJLkObfX2yXeZzWVW7gW9_Z8/edit?usp=sharing"
																		rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this</a>. Below the bullets, you copy and
																	paste the press release in the body of the email.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><em>Phone pitch</em> - Right after you send the email pitch to reporters,
																	you pick up the phone and call them. You say something like "Hi my name is Sue and I
																	just sent you an email with a press release about our exciting new solar project, do
																	you have a moment to talk about it?" Then dive in and tell them all about the
																	nonprofit and your Solar Ambassador team and how this is benefiting the community.
																	Have a short version you can pitch in a minute. Keep talking until they stop you.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Pro Tip:</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Reporters love it if you show that you’ve read their work. They get pitched
																	stories all the time. One way to get their attention is by relating your story to what
																	they already write about. Look up what they’ve written recently, compliment them on a
																	great article they wrote, and try to tie your story to it somehow. &nbsp; &nbsp;
																	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

																<p dir="ltr"><strong>Plan a Minimum of Three Events</strong></p>
																<p dir="ltr">RE-volv's ultimate goal is to help bring people together through solar
																	energy. That means that every time we put solar on a nonprofit there is an opportunity
																	to get people in the community together to learn about solar, to see how it's
																	benefiting them, to help them explore going solar at home, and to realize that the
																	solutions to climate change are in our hands.&nbsp;</p>
																<p dir="ltr">That's why such an important part of your role as a Solar Ambassador is to
																	host events and get people in your community as excited about solar as you are! We ask
																	each Solar Ambassador team to host at least three solar education events during the
																	year.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">1. Ribbon cutting - This event will require the most prep and coordination.
																	Once the installation is done, you’ll want to throw a ribbon-cutting party. At this
																	event, you’ll invite local elected officials, the media, and of course the community!
																	You'll have food, speeches, and fun to celebrate all your hard work!</p>
																<p dir="ltr">2. Solar Education Week Event - Typically, the week leading up to Earth Day
																	each year, we have each team put on a solar event to engage their community. If you
																	have a nonprofit partner you could do an event there or have an event on your college
																	campus or at any appropriate gathering place. Examples of events for Solar Education
																	Week have included:</p>
																<ul>
																	<li dir="ltr">Documentary Screening</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">Solar Trivia Night</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">5k Run/Walk for solar</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">Tabling at an Earth Day event</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">Pizza Party with solar guest speaker</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">What ever great idea you have!</li>
																</ul>
																<p dir="ltr">3. The third event is up to you! This could be a recruitment event to get
																	more members on your team, or to invite your neighbors to learn about how to go solar
																	at home. It's up to you!&nbsp;</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Pro Tip: The key to planning a great event is staying organized. We
																	recommend using this nifty <a
																		href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gA0RdwNK4uJv3uvZIfnAMSjnNa2YsOq-elu-hkF-e3c/edit?usp=sharing"
																		rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Event Planning Tracker</a> to help you and
																	your team keep track of important details and think through all the aspects of hosting
																	a great event! Also, RE-volv reimburses up to $300 annually for each team for costs
																	related to putting on events.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>PLANNING YOUR RIBBON-CUTTING EVENT&nbsp;</strong></p>
																<p dir="ltr">The hard work is all done, and now it's time to celebrate the new solar
																	installation!</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Here are some steps to plan your event:</p>
																<ul>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Work with the nonprofit staff to find a good date and time to host the
																			event</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Create a list and budget for food and drinks&nbsp;</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Create a speaker list and invite them to speak with as much advanced
																			notice as possible</p>
																	</li>
																	<li dir="ltr">
																		<p dir="ltr">Create a plan to get the word out to the community</p>
																	</li>
																</ul>
																<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Here are some key players you’ll want to add to your invite list.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>1. Local elected officials</strong> love events like this. Whether
																	it’s someone from the mayor’s office, your state legislature, or even your federal
																	representatives, politicians love opportunities to get in front of their constituents
																	and talk about things they care about.</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Inviting the official to speak is fairly easy. Typically there is a link on
																	the official's website specifically to invite them to events like this. Otherwise,
																	just call their staff and telling them the date and time of the event and see if
																	they're available.&nbsp;</p>
																<p dir="ltr">Pro Tip: Getting some high profile speakers will increase your visibility
																	and get more people to come to your event! It will also get the local press to cover
																	your event.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>2. The press</strong> also love events like this. Once you have the
																	date, time, and location confirmed, you can start reaching out to the press with a <a
																		href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vedl4jxNqQsr_yLt7lSRUYtR1ZhlM3OpZxDagB36vl4/edit#heading=h.bft4rhk1mtme">Media
																		Advisory</a>. You’ll want to make some phone calls as well in the days leading up to
																	the event – and even the day of – to remind local news outlets of your event. They
																	might be looking for something to cover at that time. If you have lined up politicians
																	to speak at the event, the press is much more likely to come and write a story about
																	the project.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>3. The community</strong> will want to celebrate this local
																	milestone, so make sure to publicize the event through all channels. Send out
																	invitations through email, social media, flyers, posters, word of mouth – anything and
																	everything that will circulate through the community. Have the nonprofit hang flyers,
																	put out postcards, and email their constituents about the event.</p>
																<p dir="ltr"><strong>4. The solar installer&nbsp;</strong>should be there
																	too.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Events like these drum up a lot of excitement around solar
																	energy and people will be interested to learn more about how solar energy could
																	benefit them. It’s a great opportunity for the solar installer to generate some leads.

															<div class="fr-view" style="text-align: center;"><strong>CREATING A VIDEO</strong></div>
															<p>The thing about solar is, because it goes on the roof, oftentimes when a nonprofit goes
																solar, no one can see it! So that's why Solar Ambassadors make a short video to tell the
																story of each RE-volv solar project. Plus it's fun!</p>
															<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>1: Find Inspiration!&nbsp;</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr">Get together with your group and watch 3-5 impactful videos that you think
																are relevant to solving climate change, promoting clean energy, or are related to your
																nonprofit's mission. Write down what worked and what you would like to emulate in your
																video, use them as examples in your pre-production doc, and reference them liberally
																throughout your scriptwriting, shooting, and editing process.</p>
															<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>2: It’s all about the pre-production&nbsp;</strong></p>
															<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Chances are, at some point in the life you’ve heard
																	about “the 5 Ps”: Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance. It’s as true for
																	filmmaking as it is for sports or musical performance, but here you can replace the 2
																	Ps of “prior preparation” with “Pre-Production.”</span></p>
															<p dir="ltr">So, before you do anything else, put together a pre-production doc that will
																be your bible for scriptwriting, shooting, and editing your video. It should contain the
																following:&nbsp;</p>
															<ul>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Video goals</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Video audience</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Video inspiration&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Length of video</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Description of the video</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">List of existing footage from the nonprofit (if applicable)</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Nonprofit interview shot list</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Nonprofit b-roll shot list&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Production timeline&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Roles and responsibilities</p>
																	<ul>
																		<li dir="ltr">
																			<p dir="ltr">Video lead (producer)</p>
																		</li>
																		<li dir="ltr">
																			<p dir="ltr">Video editor</p>
																		</li>
																		<li dir="ltr">
																			<p dir="ltr">Videographer/Lighting/Audio</p>
																		</li>
																		<li dir="ltr">
																			<p dir="ltr">Interviewer</p>
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
															</ul>
															<p dir="ltr">Spend some time on this - a good pre-production doc will make everything else
																much easier. And if you’re working with a team, be sure to share it with everyone (via
																Google Docs or otherwise) so that everyone’s on the same page.&nbsp;</p>
															<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>3: Keep it snappy</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr">One of the biggest mistakes people make when making a video is trying to
																squeeze in too much information. Studies show that you have 8 seconds to grab your
																audience's attention before they decide whether to watch more or move on to something
																more immediately entertaining. So make sure to start with a good hook!&nbsp;</p>
															<p dir="ltr">Even after you nail the intro, remember that audiences today have lots of
																demands on their time and attention, whether it’s important work, valuable family time,
																or just scrolling through social media. So make sure you deliver your message as quickly
																and efficiently as possible. Your goal should be to produce a video that is no more than
																1-2 minutes. With video, less is usually more.&nbsp;</p>
															<p dir="ltr">It’s especially important to keep this rule in mind when you conduct
																interviews. If your interviewee gives an answer that goes on too long, tell them that
																that was a great answer, but ask if they can say it again in a way that is shorter and
																more succinct. &nbsp;</p>
															<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
															<p><strong>4: Clearly identify your problem and your solution&nbsp;</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Even if your story is only 2 minutes long, it
																	needs an arc that creates interest and drama. And, like a good Hollywood movie, that
																	means having a villain and a hero!</span></p>
															<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Of course, in impact filmmaking, your villain isn’t
																	(usually) going to be a moustache-twirling criminal mastermind - it’s going to be a
																	social problem that your mission addresses, such as pollution from a coal-fired power
																	plant resulting in kids getting asthma in your community.</span></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px;">Similarly, your hero isn’t going to be wearing
																	a cape! Instead, it’s your solution - in this example, helping to support the spread
																	of solar power to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Best of all, this framing lets you
																	invite your audience to become the hero of your story by promoting it and getting
																	involved.</span></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><br></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>5: Structure your video like a good school paper</strong></p>
															<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Think back to high school or college. When you have to
																	write a paper for class, what do you need to include to get an A+?&nbsp;</span></p>
															<ul>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Introduction: We’ve already covered the intro in rule #2: deliver a good
																		synopsis of your message in the first 10 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Hypothesis: Next, state your ‘hypothesis.’ What is your mission, and how
																		will your campaign make the world a better place if you succeed?&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Proof: Make your solution real for your audience by providing the details
																		of what your mission is and how it will help make the world a better place. Can you
																		show examples of projects like this succeeding in other cases? Can you interview
																		people that would benefit from your mission?&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Conclusion: Your conclusion should be a call to action. Now that your
																		audience is motivated to help, tell them what they can do to help make solar a
																		reality in their community.&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
															</ul>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>6: Shooting/Audio/Lighting&nbsp;</strong></p>
															<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">If you know someone with video production experience and
																	equipment who can help, great! If not, here are a few ways to maximize your production
																	quality using something as simple as your phone.&nbsp;</span></p>
															<ul>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">If you’re using your phone to shoot video footage, always hold your phone
																		horizontally in landscape mode. This is the way that video editing platforms are set
																		up to edit footage.&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Make sure there is even lighting. Filming on a cloudy day is ideal so
																		there are no bright spots or dark shadows. If filming inside, use portable lamps to
																		evenly light your subject.&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Make sure you film in a quiet location with little or no background noise
																	</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">If you don't have a wireless microphone, a boom mic, Lavalier mic, then
																		make sure your camera is close to the subject (5ft maximum).</p>
																</li>
															</ul>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>7: Shoot interviews that evoke emotion</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px;">A great video needs to help your audience
																	understand why they should care about this nonprofit your helping to go solar. And
																	there’s no better way to create that personal, emotional connection than by shooting
																	good interviews with members of your nonprofit or community members served by their
																	work.&nbsp;</span></p>
															<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">Producing good interviews is an art form. The best
																	interviews provide some of the basic details of your nonprofit and their solar project
																	but also convey that information in a way that provokes an emotional response from
																	your viewer. &nbsp;</span></p>
															<p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 16px;">There’s no magic formula for how to evoke the
																	kind of responses that will make your video impactful, but here are some interview
																	tips:&nbsp;</span></p>
															<ul>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Before you begin shooting, give your interviewees a script of the points
																		you want to cover and give them the option to follow it strictly or generally.</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Make them feel comfortable - smile, nod when they are talking, tell them
																		they are doing a great job. Be super friendly!&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Warm up with some softball questions: Ask their name, their job, what
																		they do in the community, etc.</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Ask follow-up questions to go deeper on a subject or a feeling. For
																		example, how does it make you feel when you hear that asthma rates are increasing in
																		your area?&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
																<li dir="ltr">
																	<p dir="ltr">Always ask your interviewees to answer in a complete sentence and
																		incorporate the question into the answer. So if you ask “How long have you worked at
																		this nonprofit?” They would answer “I have worked at this nonprofit for three years”
																		instead of answering “three years”.&nbsp;</p>
																</li>
															</ul>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>8: Don’t forget the b-roll</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr">Video is a visual medium. So, in addition to interviews, you need to make
																sure to have plenty of good images to show to make your video compelling.</p>
															<p dir="ltr">That’s where your “b-roll” comes in. The b-roll is all the non-interview
																video footage that helps to tell the story. Examples include shots of the streets and
																neighborhood around a community organization or footage of the organization helping
																people.</p>
															<p dir="ltr">To make things easy, plan your video interviews on days when you can shoot
																lots of good material for your b-roll as well.&nbsp;</p>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>9: Music makes the mood</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr">Of course, the emotional power of video is all about the combination of image
																and sound, which is why music is an essential part of filmmaking. Can you imagine Jaws
																being half as scary without John Williams’s famous two-note theme?&nbsp;</p>
															<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">That’s why even the most inspiring mission driven by the
																	most powerful personal stories will benefit from well-chosen music. Do you want your
																	audience to feel sad? Do you want your audience to get pumped up and ready to run a
																	marathon? Find music that tells your story and takes viewers from the drama of the
																	problem to the hopefulness and positivity of your solution.&nbsp;</span></p>
															<p dir="ltr">An important part of the process is figuring out who is editing the video.
																Does anyone on your team have video editing skills? Do you know someone who does? You'll
																want to line someone up as quickly as possible so you don't end up waiting around with
																great footage but no one to edit it. (Most teams use the bulk of their RE-volv budget on
																hiring someone to shoot and edit their films.) For college students, try to find someone
																studying film at your school who's looking for projects to work on.</p>
															<p dir="ltr"><strong>10: Have a clear call to action at the end of your
																	video&nbsp;</strong></p>
															<p dir="ltr">The call to action (CTA) comes at the end of your video, but it might be the
																most crucial part other than your attention-grabbing intro. You need to ask people to
																support solar energy - and you need to do it clearly and directly.</p>
															<p dir="ltr">Ask your audience to join your Solar Ambassador team if they're local, or
																start their own Solar Ambassador team wherever they are. They might also consider going
																solar at home and supporting solar policy initiatives. Point them to RE-volv.org where
																they can find all the information they need. Almost as importantly, you also want them
																to share the video on their social networks, which will help spread the word more
																effectively and credibly. Ask and you shall receive!</p>
